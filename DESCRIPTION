Description: Fitting dimension reduction methods to data lying on two-dimensional sphere.
    This package provides principal circle, principal geodesic analysis, Hauberg's principal curves,       
    and spherical principal curves. Moreover, it offers the method of locally   
    defined principal geodesics which is underway.The detailed procedures 
    are described in Lee, J., Kim, J.-H. and Oh, H.-S. (2021) <doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2020.3025327>. 
    Also see Kim, J.-H., Lee, J. and Oh, H.-S. (2020) <arXiv:2003.02578>.
